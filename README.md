# Frontend Masters State Workshop

In this workshop, we'll build and evolve a production-ready React application with scalable state management patterns. We'll start with the basics and progressively tackle more complex state challenges by implementing event-driven architecture, handling multiple sources of truth, and optimizing performance.

## Workshop Overview

You'll learn state management principles that can be applied to any application, regardless of framework, size, or complexity. This workshop combines theory with hands-on practice through a series of progressive exercises.

### Key Takeaways

By participating in this workshop, you'll learn to:

- **Architect state management solutions** that scale with application complexity
- **Avoid common React state management pitfalls** and anti-patterns
- **Model state using event-driven patterns** for more predictable applications
- **Balance local, shared, and server state** for optimal performance
- **Debug and troubleshoot complex state issues** efficiently
